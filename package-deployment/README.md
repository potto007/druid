This packaging extends the base script and configuration docker image (named `drui`) with the druid jars.  A self contained docker image is also created that has the jars inside the docker image.

This self contained image with the druid jars is currently named `derwydd` in honor of the Welsh word for Druid:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid.
